Project Name: Multimodal AI System for Smart Healthcare Diagnosis

This system detects pneumonia using chest X-ray images.
The image modality is mandatory and provides objective evidence.

Text and speech inputs are used only to classify the type of pneumonia.
Grad-CAM highlights lung regions influencing the model’s decision.
The system does not provide treatment or medication advice.

Recommendations are confidence-based and non-prescriptive.
